# About

In the past few years, cloud computing has completely changed how organizations build, scale, and maintain workloads. The ability to quickly provision networking, storage, and compute resources, deliver software to a production environment with speed, safety, and reliability, and taking the responsibility to monitor the application and infrastructure for uptime, performance, and function has resulted in the highest developer productivity ever seen.

Many organizations moved away from their monolithic systems that served them well for many years to microservices which is the state-of-the-art software development technique that allows a complex application to be built as a suite of small services, developed around specific areas. Combined, they provide a cohesive set of functionalities and bring important business benefits.

This project embraces the DevOps method of working with microservices which is highly significant and well needed for these technologies to work at their best, highlighting key concepts to scale, synchronize and secure microservices architecture by implementing a notification-delivery system and also considering ways of optimizing the process of provisioning and managing infrastructure resources, automation servers, on-premise and services deployed in multiple environments.
