# Updating cluster via CI/CD

<< MOVE TO CI/CD SECTION >>

Each environment has its own set of defiend CI/CD pipeline stages as defined in the [CI/CD Pipeline]() section.

Any commit/merge to the development-branch in any microservice repository will automatically trigger a CI/CD pipeline, which will build the source code and update the docker image corresponding to the development version on DockerHub, likewise for any commits/merges on production-branch.

Any update in development environment will be reflected only in the development namespace and any update in production development environment will be reflected only in the production namespace.
Updates may include but not limited to the following -
1. Scaling number of pods
2. Updating deployment with newer version of docker image
3. Updaing environment variables and secrets
