# About

Many organizations moved away from their monolithic systems that served them well for many years to microservices which is the state-of-the-art software development technique that allows a complex application to be built as a suite of small services, developed around specific areas. Combined, they provide a cohesive set of functionalities and bring important business benefits.

This project embraces the DevOps method of working with microservices which is highly significant and well needed for these technologies to work at their best, highlighting key concepts to scale, synchronize and secure microservices architecture by implementing a notification-delivery system and also considering ways of optimizing the process of provisioning and managing infrastructure resources, automation servers, on-premise and services deployed in multiple environments.
